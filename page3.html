<p class="p2">My parents like ocean, I guess, because we often travel to cities that have beautiful ocean views. We have been to the La Jolla beach in San Diego, some beaches in Cancun, and Key West, but my favorite is Miami South Beach. My first ocean swimming class began here. </p>

<br><br><br><br><br><p class="p">At first, I totally hated to be put into the water. I accidentally licked a little bit water, it was too salty that made me almost vomited. I felt I was sinking, so I struggled to paddle my four short legs and swam towards the beach as fast as possible. I hated swimming. However, people surrounding were cheering. </p>
<br><br><p class="p">After a while, I was put into the sea again, but this time my mom kept holding my body and encouraged me. With her hands holding, I felt less scared and then I could keep balance in the water. After, she let go her hands slowly. I found I was moving forwards with padding legs rhythmically.
